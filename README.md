# Xiaomi_13Pro_SukiSU-Ultra

This is a repo for building kernel for Xiaomi 13 Pro (nuwa) with SukiSU, SUSFS and KPM. This is based on CRDROID Xiaomi SM8550 Kernel source, but **only works on HyperOS roms.**

> [!WARNING]
> GKI kernel source code used here is compatible for all the Xiaomi SM8550 devices, but this repo was created only for testing on devices that I have, the kernel built may not suitable for using on other devices.
